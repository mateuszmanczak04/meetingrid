# Meetingrid

## Description

Web application that helps people to find the best day possible for they to go out. It shows simple grid where days of the week are on the X-axis and attendees are on the Y-axis. 

## How to use

1. Go to the app.
2. You will be automatically redirected to the newly created event. Url will look like `/events?event_id=1234`.
3. In order to join and select days you have to enter your name.
4. Then click on the grid cells to choose days that you are available.
5. Copy the link and send to anyone you want so they can do the same.

## Tech stack

This app is fully made with Elixir+Phoenix. There are no plans for future changes like adding React on the frontend because I don't expect it to have any advanced client-side logic.
